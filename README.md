# GF_SPDC
Algorithm to extract all Green's functions for a second-order nonlinear crystal of arbitrary material, length and pump characteristics.

Requires further functionality to effectively calculate the Green's functions for very long pulses (above hundreds of ns). For very short pulses (order of fs), utilizing large amounts of CUDA cores and memory becomes necessary to extract the functions in a reasonable amount of time.
